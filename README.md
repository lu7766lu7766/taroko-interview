This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you need to clone api project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resumecompanion/taroko_server.git
# open /routes/contact.js line 253 fix word stasusCode => statusCode

# run server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
